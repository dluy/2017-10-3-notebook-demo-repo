Learning how to use github

## I'd like to do some simple formatting

Here is some **bold** text  
Here is some *italics*  
Here is some ***bold italics***  

So if you are typing and it's important to have the name of your favorite gene, *binK* in italics, it really doesn't break up your flow to just add a few asterisks

Therefore, it's useful to to write each sentence on a separate line. 
Don't worry, when they render they will look like one paragraph.

## I'd like to do some fancier formatting!!
